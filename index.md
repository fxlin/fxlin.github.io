## Research ([Publication](https://thexsel.github.io/papers.html))

I care about systems software -- mostly for computers consuming 10 Milliwatt -- 500 Watt of power. 
Today they include sensors, smartphones/devices, and edge servers. 

**My _kenshō_ on systems research** (2018-12) [PDF](/two-inquiries-v3.pdf)

At Purdue, I work with a group of students who share interest in systems software. See [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks). 

Our current work bases on two premises: 

### 1. Old kernels (e.g. Linux) are firmware 
* Transkernel: unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller-like cores ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) and [HotMobile'17](https://thexsel.github.io/papers/hotmobile17.pdf)).
* Overwatch: safeguarding unmodified file systems for IoT devices ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06327))
* Power sandbox: power awareness redefined ([Eurosys'18](https://thexsel.github.io/p/psbox/index.html)).

### 2. New OSes are defined by scenarios 
* StreamBox: stream analytics with manycores ([ATC'17](https://thexsel.github.io/p/streambox/index.html)), with 3D-stacked memory ([ASPLOS'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01328)), and with Arm TrustZone ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05078)).
* VStore: managing large archival videos for analytics ([Eurosys'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794)). 

I worked on smartphone OS for my PhD, e.g. the [K2 project](http://www.k2os.org) which won an award in ASPLOS'14. Today, I continue to work on various mobile/wearable topics. See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for all projects.

At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who share the above opinion (sometimes). See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for all the projects.
