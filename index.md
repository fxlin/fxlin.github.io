**I care system software for addressing challenges raised by new workloads and new hardware. My recent work includes OS support for stream processing, for heterogeneous memory, and for wearable devices.**

**Research overview (2018-12)** [PDF](/two-inquiries-v3.pdf)

I care about systems software, roughly speaking, for computers of which power in the (10 mW, 500 W) range. 
They include IoT sensors, smartphones, and edge servers. 

My current work bases on two premises: 

### 1. OSes are defined by important apps 
* Runtimes for stream analytics that exploit [manycores](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/streambox/index.html) and [hybrid high-bandwidth memory](). 
* Video analytics: a [data store](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794) serving queries over large videos. 

### 2. Commodity kernels (e.g. Linux) are essentially firmware 
* [Transkernel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000): executing unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller cores.
* [Power sandbox](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/psbox/index.html): power awareness redefined.

At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who buy my arguments above (sometimes). See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks).
