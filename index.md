Associate Prof. | William Wulf Faculty Fellow | UVA Computer Science | [CV](/cv.pdf) | [Contact](/contact.html)

PhD in Computer Science (Rice 2014), MS in CS (Tsinghua 2008), and BS in Automation (Tsinghua 2006). Grew up in Chongqing, known for its "3D-stacked" buildings. Before moving to UVA, I spent six great years at [Purdue](./leaving.pdf).

<!--- 
**I care system software for addressing challenges raised by new workloads and new hardware. My recent work includes OS support for stream processing, for heterogeneous memory, and for wearable devices.**
-->

**We are recruiting!**
Recent interests: 
* Geometric deep learning, algorithm x system x hardware: 3D vision, graph neural networks, etc. 
* Efficient NLP, on-device BERT/GPT
* Other systems topics, see below. 

At UVA CS, my group is looking for PhD students for building novel software. Our group has a strong builder culture. 

See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for current students and projects.

Join us in beautiful Virginia!

**Efforts on refreshing OS education** (UVA CS4414/CS6456). *Principles*: experience-based, with modern contents, and fun. *Summary*: four projects including an Arm64 baremetal kernel, multicore, trusted execution, and filesystem forensics.

The first offering in Fall'20 as CS6456. Well received!

## Research ([Publication](https://thexsel.github.io/papers.html))

<!--- 
I care about systems software -- mostly for computers consuming power roughly in the (10 Milliwatt, 500 Watt) range. 
Today they include sensors, smart phones/devices, and edge servers.

I work with a group of students with enthusiasm in systems software. See [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks). 

Our current work bases on two premises: 

### 1. Old kernels (e.g. Linux) are firmware 
* Transkernel: unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller-like cores ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) and [HotMobile'17](https://thexsel.github.io/papers/hotmobile17.pdf)).
* Overwatch: safeguarding unmodified file systems for IoT devices ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06327))
* Power sandbox: power awareness redefined ([Eurosys'18](https://thexsel.github.io/p/psbox/index.html)).

### 2. New OSes are defined by scenarios 
* Elf: autonomous AI cameras ([Mobisys'20](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00841), [3-min video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rv71kw1frkp9yqu/elf-3min.mp4?dl=0), [website](https://xumengwei.github.io/projects/elf.html), [slides](https://xumengwei.github.io/files/MobiSys-Elf-slides.pdf))
* VStore: managing large archival videos for analytics ([Eurosys'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794)). 
* StreamBox: stream analytics with manycores ([ATC'17](https://thexsel.github.io/p/streambox/index.html)), with 3D-stacked memory ([ASPLOS'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01328)), and with Arm TrustZone ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05078)).


My PhD work was on OS kernels for smartphones, e.g. the [K2 project](http://www.k2os.org) which won an award in ASPLOS'14. I continue to care about mobile/wearables, e.g. deep learning on them ([WWW'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05448) & [MobiCom'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01670)). 

<!---
At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who share the above opinion (sometimes). See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for all the projects.
