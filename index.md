**I care system software for addressing challenges raised by new workloads and new hardware. My recent work includes OS support for stream processing, for heterogeneous memory, and for wearable devices.**

## Research
I care about systems software, specifically for computers of which power in the (10 mW, 500W) range. These cover IoT sensors (e.g. Cortex-M0) and edge nodes and (single) servers. 
My current work base on two theses: 
1. OS are defined by important apps; 
1. Commodity kernels (e.g. Linux) are essentially firmware. 

Some sample projects:

### App-defined OS 
* For stream analytics: a runtime [for manycores](https://xsel.rocks/p/streambox) and [for high-bandwidth memory](). 
* For retrospective video analytics: [a data store](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794) for auto controlling video formats

### Taming OS kernels
* [Transkernel]( https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) for executing unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller cores.
* [Power sandbox](https://xsel.rocks/p/psbox)

 I work with a group of graduate students who (sometimes) buy my theses above. See the [group page](https://xsel.rocks) for paper list, etc.
