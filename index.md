[May 2020] I will UVA CS in Fall 2020. [details](/leaving.pdf) 

PhD in Computer Science (Rice 2014), MS in CS (Tsinghua 2008), and BS in Automation (Tsinghua 2006). Grew up in [Chongqing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Chongqing_Night_Yuzhong.jpg) "the city of hills".

## Research ([Publication](https://thexsel.github.io/papers.html))

I care about systems software -- mostly for computers consuming power roughly in the (10 Milliwatt, 500 Watt) range. 
Today they include sensors, smart phones/devices, and edge servers.

At Purdue, I work with a group of students who share interest in systems software. See [XSEL](http://xsel.rocks). 

Our current work bases on two premises: 

### 1. Old kernels (e.g. Linux) are firmware 
* Transkernel: unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller-like cores ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) and [HotMobile'17](https://thexsel.github.io/papers/hotmobile17.pdf)).
* Overwatch: safeguarding unmodified file systems for IoT devices ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06327))
* Power sandbox: power awareness redefined ([Eurosys'18](https://thexsel.github.io/p/psbox/index.html)).

### 2. New OSes are defined by scenarios 
* StreamBox: stream analytics with manycores ([ATC'17](https://thexsel.github.io/p/streambox/index.html)), with 3D-stacked memory ([ASPLOS'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01328)), and with Arm TrustZone ([ATC'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05078)).
* VStore: managing large archival videos for analytics ([Eurosys'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794)). 

My PhD work was on OS kernels for smartphones, e.g. the [K2 project](http://www.k2os.org) which won an award in ASPLOS'14. I continue to care about mobile/wearables, e.g. deep learning on them ([WWW'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05448) & [MobiCom'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01670)). 

See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for all projects.
