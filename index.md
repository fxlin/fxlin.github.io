**I care system software for addressing challenges raised by new workloads and new hardware. My recent work includes OS support for stream processing, for heterogeneous memory, and for wearable devices.**

## Research ([Publication](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/papers.html))
I care about systems software, mainly for computers of which power in the (10 mW, 500 W) range. These cover IoT sensors, edge nodes, and (single) servers. 
My current work base on two theses: 
1. OS are defined by important apps 
1. Commodity kernels (e.g. Linux) are essentially firmware 

Research overview slides (2018-12): [AI, app-defined OS, and the ossified Linux kernel](/two-inquiries-v3.pdf)

Sample projects:
### App-defined OS 
* For stream analytics: a runtime [for manycores](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/streambox/index.html) and [for high-bandwidth memory](). 
* For video analytics: [a data store](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794) catering to algorithmic consumers. 

### Taming OS kernels
* [Transkernel]( https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) for executing unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller cores.
* [Power sandbox](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/psbox/index.html) that redefines power awareness.

At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who (sometimes) buy my arguments above. See the [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for paper list, etc.
