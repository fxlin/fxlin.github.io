I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Rice (2014). I got my M.S. in CS (2008) and B.S. in Automation (2006), both from Tsinghua University. I grew up in [Chongqing](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Chongqing_Night_Yuzhong.jpg) "the city of hills". 

At Purdue, I am part of Center for Resilient Infrastructures, Systems, and Processes ([CRISP](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CRISP))

**I care system software for addressing challenges raised by new workloads and new hardware. My recent work includes OS support for stream processing, for heterogeneous memory, and for wearable devices.**
