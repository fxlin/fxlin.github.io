**Overview (2018-12)** [PDF](/two-inquiries-v3.pdf)

I care about systems software -- roughly speaking, for computers of which power in the (10 mW, 500 W) range. 
They include IoT sensors, smartphones, and edge servers. 

At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who share interest in systems software. See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks).
My current work bases on two premises: 

### 1. OSes are defined by important apps 
* StreamBox: A stream processing engines exploiting manycores ([ATC'17](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/streambox/index.html)) and hybrid high-bandwidth memory (ASPLOS'19). 
* A data store serving retrospective queries over large videos ([Eurosys'19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01794)). 

### 2. Commodity kernels (e.g. Linux) are essentially firmware 
* Transkernel: executing unmodified Linux drivers on microcontroller cores ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05000) and [HotMobile'17](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/papers/hotmobile17.pdf)).
* Power awareness redefined: power sandbox ([Eurosys'18](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~xzl/xsel/p/psbox/index.html)).

I worked on smartphone OS for my PhD, e.g. the [K2 project](http://www.k2os.org) which won an award in ASPLOS'14. Today, I continue to work on various mobile/wearable topics.

At Purdue, I work with a group of graduate students who share the above opinion (sometimes). See our [group page](http://xsel.rocks) for all the projects.
