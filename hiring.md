XSEL is looking for PhD students who will be involved in defining and building novel operating system and runtime.

We expect you to demonstrate a passion for understanding and building systems software.
Our group has a strong builder culture. 

When you apply, please keep in mind that we are in Purdue ECE and computer engineering.

**Notes** 

A few words on the PhD admission requirements:

* The Dec.15 [application deadline](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Graduates/Admissions/Deadlines.html) concerns _priority_ admission. You are encouraged to apply even after this date. 
  
* Purdue ECE requires GRE, but the scores specified on this [page](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/prospective/gradrequirements/westlafayette/ecen.html) are _historical average_ values, not minimum requirements. 
You are encouraged to apply even if your GRE scores are below these average values.
