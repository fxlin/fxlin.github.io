** Notes

A few words on the PhD admission requirements:

* The Dec.15 link:https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Graduates/Admissions/Deadlines.html[application deadline] concerns _priority_ admission. You are encouraged to apply even after this date. 
  
* Purdue ECE requires GRE, but the scores specified on this link:https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/prospective/gradrequirements/westlafayette/ecen.html[page] are _historical average_ values, not minimum requirements. 
You are encouraged to apply even if your GRE scores are below these average values.
